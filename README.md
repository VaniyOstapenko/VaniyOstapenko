### Hi there, I'm Ivan üëã
#### About me:

I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a focus on creating innovative solutions for web applications. As a software engineer, I am actively involved in web application development and have a good understanding of React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS (SCSS/LESS), OOP, SOLID, and REST principles.

I also have practical experience working with databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. My involvement in the development process includes testing tasks with Jest/Mocha testing frameworks, integration with Postman and Swagger, as well as product launch and technical improvement. I always explore new technologies to find more effective approaches to solving specific problems. I consider my ability to quickly find and apply efficient solutions as one of my strengths.
Please feel free to reach out with any questions or inquiries. You can contact me at ostapenkovaniykalivan@gmail.com. 
I'm happy to help and provide answers to any of your questions!
